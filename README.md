# README

this project i made it to document some RoR code by comments because i found it a better way to remember and learn.

Things i have used :

* Ruby

* Ruby on Rails

* Bootstrap

* Mysql

* Rails scaffold

* Rails generate

* MVC concept

* HTML

P.S: this project still in the basic style but i'm sure that i will add a better style when i have time.
